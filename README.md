# Cardmapper

Cardmapper is a tool to record and augment ideation card based workshops.

## How it works

### 1. Use ideation cards

Use printed ideation cards from one of the decks available here. Set up an ideation workshop and use the cards on a table, flipchart, or wall.

### 2. Turn your ideas into a “Card Map”

Take a photo of the table or wall you’ve put the cards on, upload it, and match the cards to the database.

### 3. Share your “Card Map”

Make your Card Map public: share the link to take away the outcome of the workshop, and add your Card Map to the database to share your insights with other ideation card users.

## Current status and roadmap

Cardmapper is currently a read-only demo. Future work includes:

  * Adding user registration
  * Adding an authoring interface for cardmaps
  * Adding an authoring interface for decks and cards
  * Making the database searchable
  * Adding a robust rights management interface
